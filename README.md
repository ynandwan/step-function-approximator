# step-function-approximator

Solution to programming assignment - https://github.com/ayushgupt/k-function-approximation

--
You are required to implement "function approximation" dynamic programming algorithm that was discussed in the class (Section 5.4 of the draft http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~ssen/col702/notes/root.pdf).
## Input format
&lt;k&gt;  &lt;errorType&gt;  
&lt;number Of Input Points&gt;  
&lt;point_x1&gt; &lt;point_y1&gt;  
&lt;point_x2&gt; &lt;point_y2&gt;  
&lt;point_x3&gt; &lt;point_y3&gt;  
.  
.  
.  
&lt;point_xN&gt; &lt;point_yN&gt;  

The first line gives 2 integers, the number of levels allowed in the step-function and type of error function  
The second line contains number of points (say N)  
The next N lines contains space seperated value of x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the points  
errorType will be one of the two integers (0: Mean Squared Error; 1: Max Error)  
## Output format
The first line of output should contain number of levels in your step function(say S)  
Next S lines should contain space seperated values of x-coordinate and y-coordinate of step  

## Points to Note
- X-coordinate of points in the input file will be strictly increasing  
- X-coordinate of points in the output should also be strictly increasing
- Suppose your step function contains 3 points (s1_x,s1_y),(s2_x,s2_y),(s3_x,s3_y); This means your step function's value is s1_y for \[s1_x,s2_x), s2_y for \[s2_x,s2_y) and s3_y for \[s3_x,infinity)
- So, you need to take care that step function should be defined from the smallest x-coordinate in input
- You should write only one DP that calls two different error functions to compute the best k-step approximation
- Correctness of your output will be checked by seeing you output error wrt. minimum error for that testcase.
